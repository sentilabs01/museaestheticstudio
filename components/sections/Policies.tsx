          <li><b>Avoid Sun Exposure:</b> Protect your skin from direct sunlight for at least 48 hours post-treatment. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher if sun exposure cannot be avoided.</li>
          <li><b>Keep Skin Hydrated:</b> Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated from the inside out. Apply a gentle, non-comedogenic moisturizer to the treated area as needed to prevent dryness and promote healing.</li>
          <li><b>Avoid Harsh Products:</b> Refrain from using harsh skincare products, exfoliants, or abrasive scrubs on the treated area for at least one week post-treatment. Stick to gentle, non-irritating skincare products to avoid irritation or inflammation.</li>
          <li><b>Avoid Touching or Picking:</b> Resist the urge to touch or pick at the treated area to prevent infection or scarring. Let your skin heal naturally without interference.</li>
          <li><b>Follow Specific Instructions:</b> If your skincare provider provided specific post-treatment instructions or recommendations, follow them carefully to optimize results and minimize any potential complications.</li>
          <li><b>Stay Cool:</b> Avoid activities that may cause excessive sweating or heat exposure, such as strenuous exercise, saunas, or hot tubs, for at least 48 hours post-treatment. Heat can exacerbate inflammation and irritation.</li>
          <li><b>Monitor for Side Effects:</b> Keep an eye out for any unusual or adverse reactions, such as excessive redness, swelling, itching, or blistering. If you experience any concerning symptoms, contact your skincare provider immediately.</li>
          <li><b>Follow-Up Appointment:</b> Schedule a follow-up appointment with your skincare provider as recommended to assess treatment outcomes, address any concerns, and determine if additional sessions are needed.</li>
